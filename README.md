# ShuhTheed

Welcome to our ShuhTheed game.
ShuhTheed is a card game which allows up to 6 simultaneous players.

The objective of the game is to player a card higher than the previous player, picking up the pile if this is not possible.
Some Cards have ``Special" rules which change how the game is played.

This project is an ode to our times at university where many games were played to pass the time.
